- Software Architecture Diagram 
   [2 marks: The Architecture Diagram is present, it is not formatted well, or it does not follow a known Architecture diagram.
  A web link or reference has been provided, but it does not support the used architecture]
  
  Several problems in the diagram:
  - One controller is not enough. You at least need 1 controller per model.
  - As we are implementing the MVC pattern, you need to have 1 box per model as well.
  - Google Maps API is clearly not in the database layer.
  - Services should be in a different box as well.
